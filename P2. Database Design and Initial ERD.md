# P2. Database Design and Initial ERD
## Business Problems Addressed
The database aims to solve the following business problems:
- **Inefficient Inventory Tracking:** Organizations struggle to maintain accurate records of books in stock, leading to overstocking, stockouts, and operational inefficiencies.
- **Poor Order Management:** Manual order tracking can lead to delays, errors, and poor customer satisfaction.
- **Lack of Customer Insights:** Without proper customer management, businesses cannot effectively track customer preferences or manage book holdings.
- **Limited Reporting Capabilities:** Businesses need real-time insights into sales, inventory, and revenue trends to make informed decisions.
- **Security Concerns:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to data breaches and misuse.
- **Scalability Issues:** As the business grows, the system must handle increasing inventory and user loads without performance degradation.
